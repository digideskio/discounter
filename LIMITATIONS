This constitutes a full list of known limitations or issues that have been
observed throughout development and testing.

#1) Control-C / KeyboardException / SIGINT
-- At this time, Control-C is not working properly.

#2) Windows Support
-- Since the code base is pure python, it is expected to run properly on all
-- major platforms that have Python. All tests passed successfully on both
-- OSX and Linux, however it's failing on Windows.  All of the objects being
-- passed between the processes need to be picklable of how Windows starts
-- processes differently.
--
-- To fix, I plan on creating a picklable subclass of Queue (and maybe the
-- SyncManagers) which should fix the issue.

#3) Passing entire files
-- At this point, the application is implemented that an entire file is added
-- to the job queue.  This works, but is not ideal, because you can have one
-- worker node working on a very very large job, and another worker working on
-- a one line file.  Not to mention, when a worker "downloads" a job, the entire
-- job is passed over the network.
--
-- To improve performance, we could chunk up all the files to roughly the same
-- size (x amount of bytes, careful not to cut off in the middle of a word) and
-- then add to the queue.
